## What is dwm ?

[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) is my window manager that I customized in another repo ([pendragon](https://github.com/WanderingPenwing/Pendragon)). 
It is light, simple and efficient.

## What does Turnip do ?

Turnip fetch data from my computer, format it and send it to dwm to be displayed. What it really means is that it shows me my battery usage, the current time, RAM and CPU usage.
